# Project: Identify Customer Segments

In this project, I have applied unsupervised learning technique (KMeans Clustering) to identify segments of the population in Germany that could potentially form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 
These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
The data I have used in this project has been provided by Udacity's partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
